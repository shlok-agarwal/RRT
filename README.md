# RRT

Todo:
1. write function to find path from start to goal config
2. write seperate function to connect nearest neighbor to random config till collision arrises
(if collision arises, maybe decrease the step size)
3. write function to check for collisions
4. add goal bias in the randomSampleConfig function
5. store points of end effector frames for every node added to tree, it might be useful for trajectory smoothing
6. Look how to make the endeffector follow a trajectory of points
7. understand graphhandleptr
